#Use sql query to find how many rows of data you have 
SELECT COUNT(*) AS "total number of rows" FROM credit_card_classification;

#7 Now we will try to find the unique values in some of the categorical columns:

##Offer Accepted
SELECT DISTINCT offer_accepted
FROM credit_card_classification;

##Reward
SELECT DISTINCT reward
FROM credit_card_classification;

##Household Size
SELECT DISTINCT household_size
FROM credit_card_classification;

##Mailer type
SELECT DISTINCT mailer_type
FROM credit_card_classification;

##Credit Cards Held
SELECT DISTINCT credit_cards_held
FROM credit_card_data;


#Arrange the data in decreasing order by the average_balance of the customer. Return only the customer_number of the top 10 customers with the highest average_balances in your data.

SELECT average_balance FROM credit_card_data
ORDER BY average_balance DESC;

#What is the average balance of all the customers in your data?

SELECT AVG(average_balance) AS "average balance of all customers" FROM credit_card_data;

#Use simple group_by to check the properties of some of the categorical variables in our data:
##a The average balance of the customers grouped by income level. 
SELECT  income_level, AVG(average_balance) AS total_avg_balance FROM credit_card_data
GROUP BY income_level
ORDER BY total_avg_balance ASC;
#they are all about the same, have about the same average balance despite income level

##b Average balance of customers grouped by number of bank accounts open.
SELECT  bank_accounts_open, AVG(average_balance) as total_avg_balance FROM credit_card_data
GROUP BY bank_accounts_open
ORDER BY total_avg_balance ASC;
#they all are about the same, have about same average balance regardless of how many bank accounts open

##c Average number of credit cards held by customers for each of the credit card ratings 
SELECT  credit_rating, AVG(credit_cards_held) as total_avg_cc_held FROM credit_card_data
GROUP BY credit_rating;
#Again, all about the same, customers with high credit card rating have on average 1.9 credit cards
#customers with Medium credit rating have a slightly higher average of 1.91 credit cards
#customers with low credit rating have 1.9 credit cards on average 

##show all the customers who have a high credit rating next to the number of credit cards held
#then shows the average number of credit cards held by customers with a high credit card rating
SELECT  credit_rating, avg(credit_cards_held)
FROM credit_card_data
WHERE credit_rating = "High";

#d Is there any correlation between the columns credit_cards_held and number of bank accounts open?
SELECT avg(credit_cards_held), bank_accounts_open FROM credit_card_data
GROUP BY bank_accounts_open;




#11 
SELECT * FROM credit_card_data 
WHERE (credit_rating LIKE 'medium') OR (credit_rating LIKE 'high')
AND credit_cards_held < 3;

SELECT * FROM credit_card_data 
WHERE (offer_accepted = 'Yes' AND credit_cards_held < 3 AND credit_rating != 'low'  AND own_your_home = 'Yes' AND household_size > 2);

#14
SELECT offer_accepted, COUNT(offer_accepted)  as "number of Yes and No"
